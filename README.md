# galaxy-sim
Final project for Wellesley's ASTR 210, Spring 2020 - 

A simple N-body simulation of two galaxies merging together. Just download and run the galaxies.py file. 

Loosely based on [this jupyter notebook from the VPython developers](https://github.com/vpython/vpython-jupyter/blob/master/Demos/Stars.ipynb)
